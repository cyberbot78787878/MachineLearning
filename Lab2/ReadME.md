 This project applies the US COVID-19 & Human Mobility (2021) dataset to solve a regression problem by predicting daily_cases. The model examines 935,442 rows of data to determine the relationship between human mobility (such as work or transit activity) and the spread of the virus. The objective of this project is to predict future infection outbreaks based on present social behavior.
